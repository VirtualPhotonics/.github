The Virtual Photonics Technology Initiative was established by the Laser Microbeam and Medical Program (LAMMP), an NIH/NIBIB Biotechnology Resource Center at the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic in April 2008.

### The Virtual Photonics Technology Initiative has four primary goals:

* (a) Design and distribute easy-to-use open-source software tools with graphical-user interfaces that simulate the propagation and distribution of optical radiation in cells and tissues.

* (b) Supply educational resources that provide the appropriate foundation for the proper usage of these computational tools.

* (c) Develop improved computational models to simulate and design optical diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic modalities.

* (d) Stimulate the formation of an active community of 'experts' in Computational Biophotonics interested in offering their expertise and in developing advanced simulation tools to advance this open-source effort.
